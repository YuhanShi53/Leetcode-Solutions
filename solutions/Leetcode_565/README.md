# [Leetcode 565 - Array Nesting](https://leetcode.com/problems/array-nesting/)

| Solution ID | Tag | Time | Memory | Note |
| ----------- | --- | ---- | ------ | ---- |
| 1 | Array | O(n) | O(n) | n is length of nums. Space complexity can reduced to O(1) by using reference to nums as visited watcher, but I prefer not modifying the original container until the problem asks to. |
