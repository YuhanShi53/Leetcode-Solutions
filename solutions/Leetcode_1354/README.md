# [Leetcode 1354 - Construct Target Array With Multiple Sums](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-target-array-with-multiple-sums/)

| Solution ID | Tag | Time | Memory | Note |
| ----------- | --- | ---- | ------ | ---- |
| 1 | Heap | O(n + maxAlogn) | O(n) | n is length of target. For time complexity, this first n is time to construct priority queue in cpp, logn is time to maintain the priority queue, maxA is the number of iterations. |
