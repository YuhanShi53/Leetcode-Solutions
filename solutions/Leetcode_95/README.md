# [Leetcode 95 - Unique Binary Search Tree II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/)

| Solution ID | Tag | Time | Memory | Note |
| ----------- | --- | ---- | ------ | ---- |
| 1 | Divide and Conquer | O(C1+C2+...+Cn)) | O(n*Cn) | Cn is catalan number. The complexity analysis borrow from: <https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/discuss/1440128/Python-DFS-with-Memoization-Clean-and-Concise>. The time complexity can be further reduced by caching previous computations. |
